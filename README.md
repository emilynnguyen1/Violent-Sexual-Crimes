# Predictive Analysis of Reporting Delays in Violent Sexual Crimes
**Emily Nguyen, Kaylynn Francisco-Nelson, Angela Iraya**

### Overview
---
This project investigates the reporting delays of sexually violent crimes. We aim to predict how long it takes a victim to report a violent sexual crime based on patterns in victim demographics, contextual factors, availability of resources, and population demographic features. Additionally, we analyze factors that influence reporting delays to inform data-driven prevention strategies and improve victim outreach.
